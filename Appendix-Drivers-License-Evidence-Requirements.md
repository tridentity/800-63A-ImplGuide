# Appendix: Driver's License Evidence Requirements

The Department of Homeland Security classifies U.S. states and territories into four groups with respect to their REAL ID Act compliance status. These are Compliant, Extension, Limited Extension and Noncompliant.

We selected examples from the first two categories (Compliant –Arizona, the District of Columbia; Extension –New Jersey, Texas) and reviewed the driver’s license evidence requirements for these states. In this section present their identity proofing evidence requirements in the state identity document provision process, illustrated in the following tables.

For Arizona, the requirements have been shown in Table 12. The state requires 2 documents from full list of [accepted documents](http://www.azdot.gov/docs/default-source/mvd-forms-pubs/96-0155.pdf?sfvrsn=2). One document must include a clear photo and at least 1 document must be from the Primary column. All documents must be originals or certified copies. If legal name is different from that in the document, the applicant must show proof of name change. If the applicant does not have a photo document, 3 documents from the list are required.
