# Identity Proofing of Foreign Individuals

Identity proofing is required for any applicant requesting the services of a CSP and to the extent that such services are available to foreign nationals, their identity proofing is necessary, as is the capability within a CSP to recognize and proof identities of individuals possessing foreign identification documents. Cross-border initiatives, legal frameworks and multinational industrial efforts exist to meet this challenge and offer a seamless utilization of identity management services that transcends jurisdictions and borders.

The requirements for evidence do not apply only to U.S.-based documents but cover identity documentation from any nation. CSP’s can therefore accept identity evidence from other nations should a risk assessment of their assertion levels find that they meet proofing requirements. If a foreign nation’s identity documents can be accepted as IAL3, then they can be used as a derived credential without additional proofing.

An example to consider is eIDAS, the European Regulation for the electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions, which aims to facilitate secure and seamless electronic transactions throughout the EU by providing a regulatory environment that would promote their use. For digital identities falling under eIDAS, Table 10 should be used as a guideline to map identity documents into 800-63A strength levels.

| **eIDAS Level** | **Description** | **SP800-63A Evidence Strength** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low |<ol><li>The person can be assumed to be in possession of evidence recognised by the Member State in which the application for the electronic identity means is being made and representing the claimed identity.<li>The evidence can be assumed to be genuine, or to exist according to an authoritative source and the evidence appears to be valid.<li>It is known by an authoritative source that the claimed identity exists and it may be assumed that the person claiming the identity is one and the same.</ol>| Fair |

**Table 10:** eIDAS Levels Mapped to Strengths

The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) is another example of a collaborative approach, designed to serve as a Canadian guideline for the minimum requirements for establishing an identity, and improve interoperability and manage identity risk across jurisdictions, provinces, and territories within Canada . The PCTF is designed around four Identity Assurance Levels (4 – Very high confidence that an individual is who he or she claims to be; 3 – High confidence; 2 – Some confidence; 1 – Little confidence). Requirements to establish an identity assurance level under the PCTF include the following, which are also rated from Levels 1-4:

- Uniqueness.
- Evidence of identity
- Accuracy of identity information
- Linkage of identity information to the individual

A similar mapping to that provided for eIDAS can be leveraged by CSP’s for PCTF:

| **PCTF Confidence Level** | **Expected Harm from Compromise** | **Requirements** | **SP800-63A Evidence Strength** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Some** | Minimal to Moderate | **Uniqueness:**<br/>Define identity information<br/>Define context<br/>**Evidence of Identity:**<br/>**One** instance of evidence of identity<br/>**Accuracy of Identity Information:**<br/>Identity information acceptably matches assertion by an individual and evidence of identity <br/>**and**<br/>Confirmation that evidence of identity originates from appropriate authority<br/>**Linkage of Identity Information to Individual:**<br/>No requirement | Fair |
| **High** | Moderate to Serious | **Uniqueness:**<br/>Define identity information<br/>Define context<br/>**Evidence of Identity:**<br/>**Two** instances of evidence of identity (At least one must be foundational evidence of identity)<br/>**Accuracy of Identity Information:**<br/>Identity information acceptably matches assertion by an individual and all instances of evidence of identity <br/>**and**<br/>Confirmation of the foundational evidence of identity using authoritative source<br/>**and**<br/>Confirmation that supporting evidence of identity originates from appropriate authority, using authoritative source<br/>**or** inspection by trained examiner<br/>**Linkage of Identity Information to Individual:**<br/>At least **one** of the following<br/>- Knowledge-based confirmation<br/>- Biological or behavioral characteristic confirmation <br/>- Trusted referee confirmation<br/>- Physical possession confirmation | Fair |
| **Very High** | Serious to Catastrophic | **Uniqueness:**<br/>Define identity information<br/>Define context<br/>**Evidence of Identity:**<br/>**Three** instances of evidence of identity (At least one must be foundational evidence of identity)<br/>**Accuracy of Identity Information:**<br/>Identity information acceptably matches assertion by an individual and all instances of evidence of identity <br/>**and**<br/>Confirmation of the foundational evidence of identity using authoritative source<br/>**and**<br/>Confirmation  supporting evidence of identity originates from appropriate authority, using authoritative source<br/>**or** inspection by trained examiner<br/>**Linkage of Identity Information to Individual:**<br/>At least **three** of the following<br/>- Knowledge-based confirmation<br/>- Biological or behavioral characteristic confirmation <br/>- Trusted referee confirmation<br/>- Physical possession confirmation | Superior |
