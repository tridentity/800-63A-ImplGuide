# Counter Fraud and Identity Tenure

The capability of a CSP to perform counter-fraud checks, not including validation and the review of identity evidence, affects the determined identity assurance level. The CSP should, through its own internal data sets or via reliable and independent sources, employ the following counter fraud checking capabilities:

- Whether the claimed identity has been subjected to (successful or failed) identity theft
- That the claimed identity is known to reliable and independent sources
- Whether the address is associated with identity fraud
- Whether the claimed identity is deceased
- Whether the address history of claimed identity is consistent with that declared by user

Four categories of counter-fraud checks of increasing stringency shown in Table 8 may be used by CSP’s to determine their capability level. It is up to the CSP to perform checks with sources that are:

- Authoritative: suitable source for the information sought/checked within Good Industry Practice
- Reliable: can provide a dependable service
- Independent: staff and processes operate independently from those involved in the identity proofing processes within the CSP

| **Level** | **Counter Fraud Checks** |
| --- | --- |
| **WEAK** | No confirmed evidence from an authoritative source that Claimed Identity may be deceased |
| **ACCEPTABLE** | No confirmed evidence from a reliable and authoritative source, that:<br/><ul><li>The provided Identifier is being used for fraudulent activity</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity has been subject to identity theft, whether successful or not</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity is unknown by an organization that could reasonably be expected to have knowledge of them</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity is likely to be targeted by third parties</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity may be deceased</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity is known to be a fraudulent identity</li></ul> |
| **STRONG** | No confirmed evidence, from a reliable, authoritative and independent source, that:<br/><ul><li>The provided Identifier is being used for fraudulent activity</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity has been subject to identity theft, whether successful or not</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity is unknown by an organization that could reasonably be expected to have knowledge of them</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity is likely to be targeted by third parties</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity may be deceased</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity is known to be a fraudulent identity</li></ul> |
| **SUPERIOR** | No confirmed evidence, from multiple reliable, authoritative and independent sources, that:<br/><ul><li>The provided Identifier is being used for fraudulent activity</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity has been subject to identity theft, whether successful or not</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity is unknown by an organization that could reasonably be expected to have knowledge of them</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity is likely to be targeted by third parties</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity may be deceased</li>
<li>The Claimed Identity is known to be a fraudulent identity</li></ul> |

**Table 8:** Counter Fraud Check Capabilities and Outcomes

Maintaining identity tenure or an activity history provides proof of a continuous existence of the applicant’s claimed identity going backwards in time from the point of assessment. This is especially useful in combatting synthetic identities.

Activity events may be collated across multiple evidence categories into a single activity event package to maintain identity tenure. 

Accordingly, the Activity Event relates to an interaction between the Claimed Identity and a source of Activity Events as either the Claimed Identity using the services of the source or as the source initiating an interaction with the Claimed Identity including issuing something to the Claimed Identity. Any changes in Claimed Identity that have occurred over the time period being assessed for the Activity History must also be accounted for.

The degree of assurance that can be taken from the Activity History process is linked to the quality of the data used, how easily it can be fabricated and how well its integrity is protected. Taking this into account when assessing the Activity History, CSP’s can expand the data sources and extend the history period where there is insufficient confidence in the Activity Events. 

The property of activity history can be assessed across four categories of increasing levels of strength:

- No demonstration of an identity’s activity history is required
- Claimed Identity demonstrates an activity history of at least 180 calendar days
- Claimed Identity demonstrates an activity history of at least 405 calendar days
- Claimed Identity demonstrates an activity history of at least 1080 calendar days
