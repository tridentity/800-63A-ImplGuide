# Attributes and Evidence

Once the identity assurance level for a system or subsystem has been selected, the agency should determine the attributes and identity evidence required to satisfy its use case(s).

The first step to proof an individual is to collect the core attributes necessary to establish a unique representation of the individual’s identity for use during the proofing process. The collection of these core attributes is intended to help resolve applicants to a single unique entity and to enable the appropriate level of verification and validation to support system risk and meet IAL requirements. Some commonly used core attributes are name, date of birth, address, phone number and e-mail address. The utility of core attributes in identity resolution will be discussed in the following [section](https://github.com/usnistgov/800-63A-ImplGuide/blob/master/4_Resolution.md).

Identity evidence comprises physical or digital artifacts used by a subscriber to prove the real-world existence of a claimed identity. Evidence required by the agency and provided by the applicant must contain features that support both validation (confirmed to be genuine and accurate) and verification (demonstrated to associated with the subscriber) at the appropriate strengths for a defined use case.  

It is ultimately up to the agency to determine which biographic information to collect about an applicant to meet identity resolution needs. Caution should be taken in collecting, utilizing, and storing a minimally required set of attributes. Furthermore, in accordance with requirements in 800-63A, notice must be provided to users about what information is collected, why it is collected, and what will be done with it. 

## Types of Evidence

Table 2 provides examples of evidence from each category of strength defined in the aforementioned identity evidence quality table in 800-63A. 

| **Example** | **Strength** | **Justification** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| US Passport | Superior | - Issuing source confirmed claimed identity by following written procedures <br/>- Issuing source visually identified applicant <br/>- Issuing process ensured it was delivered into possession of the person <br/>- Contains at least one reference number <br/>- Full name <br/>- Contains photograph <br/>- Contains biometric template (?) <br/>- Includes digital information <br/>- Includes physical security features <br/>- Unexpired | Under current criteria, passports could be considered as low as Fair, since they can be issued via the mail. Although passports are capable of storing biometric templates, not all passports have biometric templates on them. However, the recommendation is to consider passports Superior evidence. |

| Driver's License or ID card (RealID-compliant) | Strong | - Issuing source confirmed claimed identity by following written procedures <br/>- Issuing source visually identified applicant <br/>- Issuing process ensured it was delivered into possession of the person <br/>- Contains at least one reference number <br/>- Full name <br/>- Contains photograph <br/>- Includes digital information <br/>- Includes physical security features <br/>- Unexpired | Evidence is Weak if card is expired. Although RealID compliant cards can be issued through the mail, the recommendation is to classify driver's license as Strong due to the challenge of meeting IAL2 requirements. The majority of American citizens have a Driver's License, not stronger evidence types like passports. |
| Uniformed Services ID Card (Includes Uniformed Services Dependent ID Cards) | Strong | - Issuing source confirmed claimed identity by following written procedures <br/>- Issuing source visually identified applicant <br/>- Issuing process ensured it was delivered into possession of the person <br/>- Contains at least one reference number <br/>- Full name <br/>- Contains photograph <br/>- Includes digital information <br/>- Includes physical security features <br/>- Unexpired | The card's information is tied on the back-end to DEERS, a system that has a biometrics capability, but biometrics are not included on the card itself. http://www.cac.mil/ID-Card-Lifecycle/#identity |
| Native American Tribal Photo Identification Card | Strong | - Issuing source confirmed claimed identity by following written procedures <br/>- Issuing source visually identified applicant <br/>- Issuing process ensured it was delivered into possession of the person <br/>- Contains at least one reference number <br/>- Full name <br/>- Contains photograph <br/>- Includes digital information <br/>- Includes physical security features <br/>- Unexpired | Although there is substantial variation in tribal card design and issuing processes, the recommendation is to classify the Tribal Photo ID Card as Strong due to the challenge of meeting IAL2 requirements. Most Native Americans have a Tribal Photo ID Card, but not Superior evidence examples like a Native American Enhanced Tribal Card. |
| Driver's License or ID card (non-RealID-compliant) | Fair | - Issuing source confirmed claimed identity by following written procedures <br/>- Issuing source visually identified applicant <br/>- Issuing process means it can be reasonably assumed it was delivered into possession of the person <br/>- Contains at least one reference number <br/>- Full name <br/>- Contains photograph <br/>- Includes physical security features <br/>- Unexpired | Evidence is Weak if card is expired. Main difference between Real ID compliant and non-compliant is the identity proofing process, but both have identity proofing processes. |
| School ID card w/ photograph | Fair | - Issuing source confirmed claimed identity by following written procedures <br/>- Issuing source visually identified applicant <br/>- May contain at least one reference number <br/>- Full name <br/>- Contains photograph | Unacceptable if does not contain a unique reference number. Although issuing processes vary across schools, most cards contain a full name, photograph, and reference number. |
| Utility account statement | Fair | - Issuing source confirmed claimed identity <br/>- Issuing process can be reasonably assumed it was delivered to person <br/>- The evidence contains a unique reference number | Remains at Fair due to credit check run on individuals setting up utility accounts. |
| Credit Card | Fair | - Issuing source confirmed claimed identity <br/>- Issuing process can be reasonably assumed it was delivered to person <br/>- The evidence contains a unique reference number |  |
| Bank statement | Fair | - Issuing source confirmed claimed identity <br/>- Issuing process can be reasonably assumed it was delivered to person <br/>- The evidence contains a unique reference number |  |
| US Social Security Card | Weak | - Issuing source confirmed claimed identity <br/>- Issuing process can be reasonably assumed it was delivered to person <br/>- The evidence contains a unique reference number | Although it meets the criteria for Fair, it is being recommended as a Weak evidence type. It is not an identity document, but rather a bridge/eligibility document.  |
| Original or certified copy of a birth certificate issued by a state, county, municipal authority or outlying possession of the United States bearing an official seal | Weak | - Issuing source did not perform identity proofing <br/>- Issuing process means it can be reasonably assumed it was delivered to the person <br/>- Contains at least one reference number |  |

**Table 2: Evidence Strengths and Examples**

For each example at strength levels Superior through Unacceptable, justifications for the strength level have been provided. Please note that while examples of unacceptable and weak evidence are presented here for the sake of completeness, agencies should nevertheless be careful in requiring such documents as identity evidence.

Agencies are cautioned to review guidance on international or common names and the event of a name change while considering evidence for strength.

An example selection of evidence documents for an agency to consider in an IAL2 process are shown in the following figure.

## Collection Techniques

Agencies may use multiple techniques for collecting attributes and evidence in different media. These pertain to digital or other methods of collection that result in the transmission of information from the applicant to the agency. As noted earlier, while the processes laid out in this guide suggest multiple phases of collection, it is possible that agencies or agencies could choose to collect core attributes, additionally required attributes, and evidence during the same event. Multiple techniques may also be combined based on agency requirements, user needs, and the overall approved proofing process flow.

Submitting evidence and attributes in multiple stages can become burdensome for an applicant. It is important to consider collecting the appropriate evidence up-front to avoid requiring the user to perform multiple interactions in order to establish an account. There should be a good balance between executing the proofing process and minimizing the burden on the applicant.

### Digital

The initial information may be captured via an online form directly from the applicant that is being proofed.
In other cases, the agency may allow the applicant to provide some documents via remote means, such as submitting an image of an identification document like a passport or a driver’s license. This workflow requires the utilization of some form of digital capture, such as a camera or a document scanner. Systems with optical character recognition capabilities that allow fields in a document to be pre-populated upon scanning should also allow the applicant to review and validate the information as correct. Some agencies may choose to enforce requirements more directly by providing mobile applications for collection –e.g. camera capture functions that provide an overlay and illumination check feature to ensure applicants provide pictures with correct size and brightness.

Some of the methods with which an agency can digitally capture evidence are listed in Table 3.

| **Method** | **Device** | **Information** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Photo Capture | Camera | This can be used to capture an applicant’s photo or the image of an evidence such as a driver’s license. Agencies can consider pictures at 300 dpi or above to be of sufficient resolution. |
| Document Capture | Scanner | This can capture a document, which is compared against a known template by automated software to extract information. For optical character recognition, scans at high than 300 dpi are typically considered to be of sufficient quality. |
| Barcode | Scanner | Commercial off-the-shelf scanners can capture and extract information from standardized barcodes embedded on identity evidence. |

**Table 3** Digital Collection Methods

###	In-Person

If an agency allows in-person registration, it may consider, for efficiency and convenience purposes, executing additional steps in the process, such as evidence validation, at the time of registration. The agency may provide kiosks to allow applicants to enter their information directly. Alternatively, users may meet with a representative of the agency to allow them to enter the applicant’s information on their behalf. Note --when this is done it is important the process is conducted in a manner that allows the individual to verify their information has been accurately captured and input into the collection system. Training should be provided for all agency representatives to ensure that they are aware of organizational and federal policy concerning privacy and user experience.

###	Paper Form

In the event an applicant does not have access to a connected device, is unable to use a computer, or otherwise wishes to submit the biographic information via a non-digital medium, the agency may offer the option to complete a paper form instead. Written entry of information should be avoided if it is possible to capture information via multiple choice selections and the applicant should be instructed to print clearly to reduce inaccuracies resulting from the interpretation of handwriting. Some organizations require enrollment via paper form only in person while some implementations may allow the applicant to complete the form remotely and mail it in. It is also important to note that in many use cases applicants are asked to fill out a paper form with sensitive personal information and mail it to the requesting organization. Precautions should be taken to minimize that risk and maintain transparency by informing the individual of the risks while the paper form is in transit.
