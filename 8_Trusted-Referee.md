# Trusted Referee

In instances where the individual enrolling cannot meet the identity evidence requirements specified in Section 4.5.1., the agency can use a trusted referee to assist in identity proofing the enrollee. See Section 5.3.4. for more details. These referees can be notaries, legal guardians, medical professionals, conservators, persons with power of attorney, or other trained, certified or approved individuals that can that can vouch for or act on behalf of the applicant. It follows that referees also need to have proof of identity in order to confirm their status. The applicable laws, regulations or agency policy that govern the use of trusted referees for identity proofing also determine the limits of liability for such referees in the event of mischief by the applicant. 

An example in which trusted referees are used is the identity proofing of minors.

The Minors Trust Framework (MTF), an online identity trust model created under NIST’s National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace Pilot Grant program, is an example framework that establishes identities for minors to facilitate secure private online access to services subject to approval or a trusted referee. MTF’s business process flow has been illustrated in Figure 3.

The need for trusted referees also arises when one of a number of possible exceptions is encountered during the identity proofing process.

While requirements and guidelines make every effort to cover all possible scenarios including rare corner cases, areas may be identified throughout this guide wherein exceptions may occur. The process of identity proofing is an assertion of a particular level of confidence based on the information presented at the time of proofing and is therefore not absolute; challenges may be found due to applicants with disabilities, the geographic feasibility of the process, or issues with uniqueness, including but not limited to examples such as:

- People whose birth was not registered
- People who are homeless or itinerant
- Undocumented arrivals
- People living in remote areas
- People who are transgender or intersex
- People affected by natural disasters
- People with limited access to identity documents (due, for instance, to having been raised in institutional or foster care)
- People with limited participation in society
- People who have no established social footprint

Agencies are encouraged to contribute past experiences with their exception processes and mitigating controls put into practice to move past the challenge.
